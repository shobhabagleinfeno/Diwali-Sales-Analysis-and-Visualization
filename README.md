Diwali Sales Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I analyzed Diwali sales data to uncover patterns in consumer behavior using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis focused on demographic factors such as age, marital status, occupation, and regional preferences. Key insights include identifying high-value consumer segments, preferred product categories, and demographic profiles.

Key Findings:

Customer Segment: Married women aged 23-35 were the largest customer segment.
Top States: Consumers primarily came from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
Occupations: Major buyers worked in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
Product Preferences: Popular categories included Food, Clothing, and Electronics.
This analysis provides actionable insights for targeted marketing and sales strategies during festive seasons.
